# Code Samples and Open Source Projects
This repository is dedicated to my personal code samples and open source projects. I'm the proprietor of Pacific Brewing Supplies, a retail homebrewing shop located in San Dimas, California. Before running the retail shop, I worked as a software engineer. You can find my LinkedIn profile here: https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlest/.

## About Me
As a software engineer turned homebrewing enthusiast, I enjoy exploring the intersection of technology and brewing. I have developed a number of tools and applications to help me with my tasks here in the shop and am excited to share them with the community.

## Repository
This Github repository has been set up to share my personal code samples and open source projects related to homebrewing and software development. I encourage you to explore the repository and try out my code samples and projects.

## Collaboration
I am open to collaboration with other developers and homebrewing enthusiasts. If you have any questions about my projects, feel free to contact me.  If you are interested in collaborating on a project, or sharing recipes, take a look at our local homebrew club's repository here: https://github.com/horsethiefhba

## Feedback
I welcome any feedback you may have about my code samples and open source projects. If you find any issues or bugs, please let me know by opening an issue on Github. I am always looking for ways to improve my projects and provide the best possible tools and resources for the homebrewing community.
